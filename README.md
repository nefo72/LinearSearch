<h1>Linear Search </h1>
This is an implementation of the linar search algorithm on a queue.
First it creates a queue that is filled manually  with random numbers,
and the asks for the number to search for, finally returns the position
of that number within the queue.
The file also contains functions to manage the queue:
<ul>
  <li><b>createQueue</b>  To create the queue</li>
  <li><b>createNode</b>  To create the  node that will be placed in the queue</li>
  <li><b>enqueue</b>  To add a  node in the queue</li>
  <li><b>dequeue</b>  To delete a  node from the queue</li>
  <li><b>isEmpty</b>  To check if the queue is empty</li>
  <li><b>show</b>  To print the content of the queue</li>
  <li><b>deleteAll</b>  To empty the queue</li>
  <li><b>copyQueue</b>  To copy the contents from one que to another</li>
  
</ul>
<b>Note</b> The project is in not finished and some functions may fail, due to modifications. I'll be corrected them later
